## üìù Code Commenting Guidelines

To maintain code clarity and help future contributors understand the functionality, **all components** should be well-commented, explaining their purpose, features, and any important details. This helps anyone new to the project quickly grasp how the code works.

### Comment Format

Each component should have a **header comment** at the top, describing:

- What the component does
- Key elements or features inside the component
- Any styling or layout details that are important

**Example:**

```bash
/**
 * HeroSection component
 *
 * This component renders a hero section at the top of the page.
 * It includes:
 * - A headline describing the service.
 * - A short paragraph explaining the key benefits.
 * - A call-to-action button ("Get Started").
 * - A background image that complements the theme.
 *
 * The section is styled to overlay the text and button on top of the image
 */
```

### Why This Matters

- **Readability:** Clear, descriptive comments make it easier for anyone (including yourself) to jump into the project at any time and understand how a component works.
- **Maintainability:** As the project grows, well-commented code is easier to modify without breaking functionality.
- **Collaboration:** When multiple people are working on the project, consistent comments ensure that everyone is on the same page.

Please ensure that all new components follow this commenting style.
